# ENCODING vs HASHING vs ENCRYPTING
Encoding = transforms data into a publicly known scheme for usability Hashing
= one-way cryptographic function nearly impossible to reverse Encrypting =
mapping of input data and output data reversible with a key CPU vs GPU
CPU = 2-72 cores mainly optimized for sequential serial processing GPU =
1000’s of cores with 1000’s of threads for parallel processin
